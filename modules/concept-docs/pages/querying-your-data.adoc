{sqlpp} is a declarative query language for JSON data.



== Real-Time Data Analysis

Traditionally, analyzing JSON data in NoSQL databases requires complex transformations (like flattening) to prepare it for analytics, causing delays and hindering real-time insights.
Capella Columnar eliminates these ETL complexities by unifying operational and analytical data stores into a single platform.
This enables Zero ETL, reducing costs, complexity, and improving time to insight.
