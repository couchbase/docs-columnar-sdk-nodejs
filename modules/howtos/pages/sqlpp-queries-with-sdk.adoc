On this page we dive straight into using the Query Service API from the {name-sdk}.
For a deeper look at the concepts, to help you better understand the Query Service, and the {sqlpp} language, see the links in the <<further-information,Further Information>> section at the end of this page.




Here we show queries against the Travel Sample collection, at cluster and scope level,
and give links to information on adding other collections to your data.
