{description}


Customized logging is not yet implemented.
Use of the console logger (detailed below) is currently recommended.

== Logging via Environmental Settings

In the command line environment, the `CBPPLOGLEVEL` variable is set as follows:

.GNU/Linux and Mac
[source,console]
----
export CBPPLOGLEVEL=<log-level>
----

.Windows
[source,console]
----
set CBPPLOGLEVEL=<log-level>
----

== Log Levels

You can increase the log level for greater verbosity (more information) in the logs:

* off -- disables all logging, which is normally set by default.
* error -- error messages.
* warn -- error notifications.
* info -- useful notices, not often.
* debug -- diagnostic information, required to investigate problems.
* trace -- the most verbose level.
