== Platform Compatibility


=== Node.js Version Compatibility

The {sdk_dot_minor} Node.js SDK will run on recent LTS versions of Node.js: 20 and 22.
We recommend using the most recent long-term support (LTS) version of Node.js -- 
at the time of writing (October 2024) this is version 22.
 
TIP: Remember to keep your Node.js installation up to date, via `npm`.



=== OS Compatibility

=== Network Requirements

== Capella Columnar Compatibility


Capella Columnar is a fully hosted service, continually updated, and offering the latest version --
with users having a few weeks to upgrade from the previous version.
As such, the latest Couchbase Columnar SDKs are tested against the latest versions.
Where older versions of the {name-sdk} pre-date significant new features in Columar, those differences will be noted in this section.


To make development easier, the SDK includes the Capella client certificate ready installed.
